# Casual Caving GL

This is the third iteration of the Casual Caving codebase, now coded in Java using the OpenGL framework.

# OS Requirements

**Casual Caving does not work on MacOS**, but functions on all other platforms. We hope to bring support to MacOS eventually.
However, the fonts used in the game are platform-dependent at this time, so results may vary. Best results are acheived on Windows.

Java is required and must be updated to the latest version in order to play on all platforms.
