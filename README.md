# Casual Caving GL

This is the third iteration of the Casual Caving codebase, now coded in Java using the OpenGL framework.

# OS Requirements

**Casual Caving does not work on MacOS**, but functions on all other platforms. We hope to bring support to MacOS eventually. Best results are acheived on Windows.

If you do not use the EXE download, Java is required and must be updated to the latest version in order to play.
